Review current work and identify documentation that needs updating
per @CONTRIBUTING.md requirement: "always update docs related to the work we are doing within the PR".

## Documentation Assessment

### 1. Identify Changes

Analyze git diff to understand scope:

```bash
git diff origin/dev --name-only
```

Categorize changes:

- Architecture/workflow changes
- New features or APIs
- Process modifications
- Configuration changes
- Database schema changes

### 2. Required Documentation Updates

Based on changes, check if these need updates:

#### High-Level Docs (ALWAYS update in same PR)

- **CLAUDE.md**: Architecture, commands, setup
  - Check if: New commands, workflow changes, tech stack updates
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Development process, workflows
  - Check if: Process changes, new requirements, workflow modifications

#### Specialized Docs

- **Database**: `docs/database/` (schema, RLS, migrations)
  - Check if: Schema changes, new tables, RLS patterns
- **API Docs**: `docs/api/` (endpoints, webhooks)
  - Check if: New routes, API changes, webhook modifications
- **Feature Docs**: `docs/` (feature-specific)
  - Check if: New features, major functionality changes

#### Code Documentation

- **Inline comments**: Complex logic
- **README**: Feature directories
- **ADRs**: `docs/adr/` (architectural decisions)
  - Check if: Significant architecture decisions made
