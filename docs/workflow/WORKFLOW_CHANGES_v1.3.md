**Last Updated**: 2025-10-06

## Version History

### v1.3.1 - System Architect Review Gate (2025-10-06)

#### What Changed

**Added**: MANDATORY System Architect review for complex automation/infrastructure code

**Rationale**: WOR-321 gap discovery - 710-line bash script + 641-line CI/CD workflow deployed WITHOUT architectural review

#### The Gap (WOR-321)

**What Happened**:

- ARCHitect-in-CLI orchestrated 10 subagent invocations
- Data Engineer delivered 710-line bash deployment script (`deploy-migration-prod.sh`)
- Data Engineer delivered 3 TypeScript validation scripts
- RTE delivered 641-line CI/CD workflow (`migration-validation.yml`)
- System Architect was **NEVER invoked**
- Complex automation merged without architectural oversight

**Impact**:

- Potential security/quality issues in unreviewed code
- Violated architectural governance process
- No quality gate before PR
- Security-critical code (SSH, Docker, database access) unreviewed

#### The Fix (v1.3.1)

**New Requirement**: ARCHitect-in-CLI MUST invoke System Architect for:

**Infrastructure & Automation**:

- Bash scripts >100 lines
- CI/CD workflows
- Infrastructure-as-code
- Deployment automation
- Container orchestration

**Security-Critical Code**:

- Database migration automation
- Auth/authorization logic
- SSH/remote execution
- Secret management
- RLS policy automation

**Complex Code**:

- TypeScript/JavaScript >200 lines
- Custom build tools
- Database query builders
- Pre-commit hooks

**Process**:

1. Specialist delivers complex code
2. ARCHitect-in-CLI invokes System Architect for review
3. System Architect approves OR requires fixes
4. Only after approval: Create PR

#### Workflow Comparison

**Before v1.3.1 (WOR-321 Gap)**:

```
ARCHitect-in-CLI
├─ Data Engineer (710-line script)
├─ Data Engineer (3 TypeScript scripts)
├─ RTE (641-line CI/CD workflow)
└─ [CREATE PR] ← Missing System Architect review ❌
```

**After v1.3.1 (Correct)**:

```
ARCHitect-in-CLI
├─ Data Engineer (710-line script)
├─ System Architect (Review script) ← ADDED ✅
├─ Data Engineer (Address feedback)
├─ Data Engineer (3 TypeScript scripts)
├─ System Architect (Review scripts) ← ADDED ✅
├─ RTE (641-line CI/CD workflow)
├─ System Architect (Final review) ← ADDED ✅
└─ [CREATE PR] ← Only after approval ✅
```

#### Success Metrics

v1.3.1 prevents gaps when:

- 100% of complex automation reviewed before PR
- Architectural decisions documented
- Security patterns validated
- Code quality standards enforced

**Measurable Outcomes**:

- 0% unreviewed scripts >100 lines in production
- 100% System Architect approval for complex code
- Reduced production incidents from bad automation
- Higher team confidence in deliverables

### v1.3 - ARCHitect-in-CLI Direct Orchestration (2025-10-05)

#### What Changed

**Pattern**: ARCHitect-in-CLI orchestrates specialists directly (not through TDM)

**Rationale**:

- Faster coordination (no TDM intermediary)
- Direct communication with specialists
- Parallel invocation when no dependencies
- ARCHitect-in-CLI maintains context

#### Workflow Pattern

```
ARCHitect-in-CLI (Main Instance)
├─ Invokes specialists directly
├─ Coordinates parallel work
├─ Validates deliverables
└─ Creates PR (after all work complete)
```

**vs v1.2 (TDM Orchestration)**:

```
ARCHitect-in-CLI
└─ TDM (Orchestrator)
    ├─ Invokes specialists
    └─ Coordinates work
```

#### Benefits

- **Efficiency**: No intermediary overhead
- **Context**: ARCHitect-in-CLI maintains full investigation context
- **Flexibility**: Can invoke specialists in parallel or sequence as needed
- **Quality**: Direct validation of deliverables

#### When to Use

- Complex investigations requiring multiple specialists
- Work with clear dependencies (sequential) or independence (parallel)
- ARCHitect-in-CLI has full context of requirements

---

### v1.2 - TDM Orchestration (2025-09-15)

#### What Changed

**Pattern**: TDM coordinates specialist invocations

**Rationale**:

- Clear separation of concerns
- TDM expertise in coordination
- Standardized handoffs

#### Workflow Pattern

```
ARCHitect-in-CLI
└─ TDM
    ├─ BSA (Requirements)
    ├─ Specialist (Implementation)
    ├─ QAS (Testing)
    └─ RTE (PR)
```

#### When to Use

- Standard feature development
- Clear requirements with defined scope
- Multiple teams coordinating

---

### v1.1 - Specialist Direct Invocation (2025-09-01)

#### What Changed

**Pattern**: ARCHitect-in-CLI invokes single specialist for focused work

**Rationale**:

- Simple tasks don't need orchestration
- Direct communication for clarity
- Faster turnaround

#### Workflow Pattern

```
ARCHitect-in-CLI
└─ Specialist (Complete work)
```

#### When to Use

- Single-specialist tasks
- Documentation updates
- Simple bug fixes
- Configuration changes

---

### v1.0 - Baseline Workflow (2025-08-15)

#### Initial Pattern

**Simulated Subagent Work**: ARCHitect-in-CLI performed all work, simulating specialist roles

**Rationale**:

- Proof of concept
- No actual subagent invocation capability
- Single-agent workflow

#### Limitations

- No true specialization
- No parallel work
- Limited scalability
- No architectural governance

## Pattern Selection Guide

### Decision Tree

```
What type of work?
├─ Documentation only → v1.1 (Direct specialist)
├─ Simple feature → v1.2 (TDM orchestration)
├─ Complex investigation → v1.3 (ARCHitect-in-CLI orchestration)
└─ Complex automation → v1.3.1 (+ System Architect review)
```

### Complexity Indicators

**Use v1.3.1 (System Architect Review) when**:

- Creating bash scripts >100 lines
- Modifying CI/CD workflows
- Building infrastructure automation
- Implementing security-critical code
- Writing complex TypeScript/JavaScript >200 lines

**Use v1.3 (Direct Orchestration) when**:

- Multiple specialists needed
- Clear dependencies between work
- ARCHitect-in-CLI has full context
- Parallel work possible

**Use v1.2 (TDM Orchestration) when**:

- Standard feature development
- Multiple teams involved
- Clear requirements defined
- TDM coordination valuable

**Use v1.1 (Direct Specialist) when**:

- Single specialist sufficient
- Simple, focused task
- Quick turnaround needed
- No dependencies
