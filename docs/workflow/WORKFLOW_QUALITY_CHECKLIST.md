## Subagent Orchestration Quality

### All Necessary Specialists Invoked?

- [ ] **Tech Writer** for documentation
- [ ] **Data Engineer** for database/backend changes
- [ ] **Security Engineer** for RLS/security validation
- [ ] **FE Developer** for UI changes
- [ ] **BE Developer** for API/server logic
- [ ] **RTE** for CI/CD changes
- [ ] **System Architect** for complex code review ← **CRITICAL**
- [ ] **BSA** for requirements clarification (if needed)
- [ ] **QAS** for testing strategy (if needed)

### Correct Specialist for Each Task?

- [ ] Database changes → Data Engineer (NOT BE Developer)
- [ ] Documentation → Tech Writer (NOT Data Engineer)
- [ ] Security → Security Engineer (NOT QAS)
- [ ] Architectural review → System Architect (NOT skipped)
- [ ] CI/CD workflows → RTE (NOT BE Developer)
- [ ] Testing strategy → QAS (NOT FE Developer)

### Parallel vs Sequential Invocation?

- [ ] Independent tasks invoked in parallel (efficiency)
- [ ] Dependent tasks invoked sequentially (correctness)
- [ ] Complex code reviewed BEFORE PR (governance)
- [ ] No unnecessary waiting (optimal coordination)

## WOR-321 Retrospective Check

**Purpose**: Prevent WOR-321-type gaps in future work

### Gap Prevention Questions

**Question 1**: Did I create complex automation?

- [ ] **NO** → Skip to next section
- [ ] **YES** → Continue to Question 2

**Question 2**: Did I create bash scripts >100 lines?

- [ ] **NO** → Continue to Question 3
- [ ] **YES** → System Architect review REQUIRED

**Question 3**: Did I create CI/CD workflows?

- [ ] **NO** → Continue to Question 4
- [ ] **YES** → System Architect review REQUIRED

**Question 4**: Did I create TypeScript/JavaScript >200 lines?

- [ ] **NO** → Continue to Question 5
- [ ] **YES** → System Architect review REQUIRED

**Question 5**: Did I create security-critical code?

- [ ] **NO** → Continue to Question 6
- [ ] **YES** → System Architect review REQUIRED

**Question 6**: Did System Architect review all complex code?

- [ ] **YES** → Proceed with confidence ✅
- [ ] **NO** → BLOCK PR - Invoke System Architect now ❌

### Self-Check Question

**"Would WOR-321 gap happen with this workflow?"**

- [ ] **NO** → Proceed with confidence
- [ ] **YES** → Fix before PR
- [ ] **UNSURE** → Review WOR-321 report, invoke System Architect

### WOR-321 Gap Indicators

**⚠️ WARNING SIGNS** (If ANY apply, review workflow):

- [ ] Created 710-line bash script without review
- [ ] Created CI/CD workflow without review
- [ ] Created TypeScript scripts without review
- [ ] Skipped System Architect review for complex code
- [ ] Created PR without architectural approval

**If ANY warning signs present: STOP - Review workflow and invoke System Architect**

### Pattern 2: Simple Code Changes

**Checklist Result**:

- ✅ Code changes <100 lines
- ✅ Tests passing
- ✅ System Architect review: N/A
- ✅ Ready for PR

**Example**: Bug fixes, configuration updates

### Pattern 3: Complex Automation (MANDATORY Review)

**Checklist Result**:

- ✅ Complex code created
- ✅ System Architect review: REQUIRED
- ✅ System Architect approval: OBTAINED
- ✅ All feedback addressed
- ✅ Ready for PR

**Example**: Deployment scripts, CI/CD workflows, validation tools

## Failure Patterns (Avoid These)

### Anti-Pattern 1: WOR-321 Gap

**What Happened**:

- ❌ Created 710-line bash script
- ❌ Created 641-line CI/CD workflow
- ❌ Created 3 TypeScript scripts
- ❌ System Architect review: NOT OBTAINED
- ❌ PR created anyway

**Result**: Unreviewed security-critical code in production

**Prevention**: This checklist would have blocked PR creation

### Anti-Pattern 2: Skipping Quality Gates

**What Happened**:

- ❌ Tests not run locally
- ❌ CI/CD validation skipped
- ❌ Documentation incomplete
- ❌ PR created anyway

**Result**: Failed CI/CD, PR rejected, rework required

**Prevention**: Complete all quality gates before PR

### Anti-Pattern 3: Wrong Specialist Assignment

**What Happened**:

- ❌ BE Developer for database migration (should be Data Engineer)
- ❌ Data Engineer for documentation (should be Tech Writer)
- ❌ No System Architect review for complex code

**Result**: Suboptimal deliverables, missing expertise

**Prevention**: Use correct specialist for each task
