## When to Invoke System Architect

**CRITICAL UPDATE (v1.1)**: Based on WOR-321 gap discovery, System Architect review is **MANDATORY** for complex code.

### Decision Tree

```
Created code/automation during investigation?
├─ YES → Check complexity
│   ├─ Bash script >100 lines? → MANDATORY System Architect review
│   ├─ CI/CD workflow? → MANDATORY System Architect review
│   ├─ Infrastructure automation? → MANDATORY System Architect review
│   ├─ TypeScript/JavaScript >200 lines? → MANDATORY System Architect review
│   └─ Security-critical code? → MANDATORY System Architect review
└─ NO (documentation only) → Proceed with PR
```

**Documentation-only changes** (markdown, config docs) do NOT require architectural review.

**Complex code ALWAYS requires review BEFORE PR creation.**

### Review Triggers (Comprehensive List)

#### Infrastructure & Automation

- Bash scripts >100 lines
- CI/CD workflow creation/modification
- Infrastructure-as-code (Terraform, CloudFormation)
- Deployment automation scripts
- Container orchestration changes

#### Security-Critical Code

- Database migration automation
- Authentication/authorization logic
- SSH/remote execution scripts
- Secret management code
- RLS policy automation

#### Complex TypeScript/JavaScript

- Validation/verification scripts >200 lines
- Pre-commit hooks
- Custom build tools
- Database query builders

### How to Invoke System Architect

**After specialist delivers complex code**, invoke System Architect for review:

```typescript
Task({
  subagent_type: "system-architect",
  description: "Review WOR-XXX automation scripts",
  prompt: `Architectural review required for WOR-XXX deliverables.

Files to Review:
- scripts/deploy-migration-prod.sh (710 lines bash)
- scripts/pre-migration-audit.ts (TypeScript with Prisma)
- scripts/validate-migration-rls.ts (TypeScript pre-commit hook)
- .github/workflows/migration-validation.yml (641 lines CI/CD)

Review Focus:
1. Code quality and best practices
2. Security patterns (SSH, Docker, database access)
3. Error handling and edge cases
4. Pattern consistency across files
5. Architectural design decisions

Provide:
- Approval with recommendations, OR
- Required fixes with detailed reasoning

Context:
[Brief description of what automation does, why needed, production impact]

Reference: WOR-XXX investigation findings`,
});
```

### Example: WOR-321 Gap

**What Happened**: ARCHitect-in-CLI did NOT invoke System Architect for:

- 710-line bash deployment script (`deploy-migration-prod.sh`)
- 3 TypeScript validation scripts
- 641-line CI/CD workflow (`migration-validation.yml`)

**Should Have**: Invoked System Architect after Data Engineer and RTE deliverables

**Impact**: Unreviewed security-critical code in production path

**Lesson**: **Always invoke for complex code, BEFORE finalizing work**

---

## Workflow Patterns

### Pattern 1: Documentation-Only Investigation

**When**: Investigation produces only documentation (no executable code)

**Workflow**:

```
ARCHitect-in-CLI
├─ Tech Writer (Documentation)
├─ Tech Writer (Additional docs)
└─ [CREATE PR] ← No System Architect review needed
```

**Example**: Creating runbooks, best practices guides, workflow documentation

---

### Pattern 2: Simple Code Changes

**When**: Small code changes (<100 lines, non-critical)

**Workflow**:

```
ARCHitect-in-CLI
├─ Specialist (Implementation)
├─ QAS (Testing)
└─ [CREATE PR] ← System Architect review optional
```

**Example**: Bug fixes, minor refactoring, configuration updates

---

### Pattern 3: Complex Automation (MANDATORY Review)

**When**: Complex code/automation created (triggers System Architect review)

**Correct Workflow**:

```
ARCHitect-in-CLI
├─ Specialist (Complex code)
├─ System Architect (Review) ← MANDATORY
├─ Specialist (Address feedback if needed)
├─ System Architect (Re-review if fixes required)
└─ [CREATE PR] ← Only after approval
```

**Example**: Deployment scripts, CI/CD workflows, infrastructure automation

**WOR-321 Gap** (What NOT to do):

```
ARCHitect-in-CLI
├─ Data Engineer (710-line script) ❌
├─ RTE (641-line workflow) ❌
└─ [CREATE PR] ← System Architect NEVER invoked ❌
```

---

### Pattern 4: Multi-Specialist Coordination

**When**: Work requires multiple specialists with dependencies

**Workflow**:

```
ARCHitect-in-CLI
├─ BSA (Spec)
├─ Data Engineer (Schema)
├─ System Architect (Review schema) ← If complex
├─ BE Developer (API)
├─ FE Developer (UI)
├─ Security Engineer (RLS validation)
├─ System Architect (Final review) ← If complex code
├─ QAS (Testing)
└─ RTE (PR creation)
```

**Key**: System Architect review at TWO points:

1. After complex code creation
2. Before PR creation (final validation)

---

## Orchestration Best Practices

### 1. Parallel vs Sequential Invocation

**Parallel** (when no dependencies):

```typescript
// Invoke multiple specialists simultaneously
Task({ subagent_type: "tech-writer", ... })
Task({ subagent_type: "data-engineer", ... })
Task({ subagent_type: "security-engineer", ... })
```

**Sequential** (when dependencies exist):

```typescript
// Step 1: Create code
Task({ subagent_type: "data-engineer", ... })

// Step 2: Review code (MANDATORY if complex)
Task({ subagent_type: "system-architect", ... })

// Step 3: Create PR (only after approval)
Task({ subagent_type: "rte", ... })
```

### 2. Specialist Selection

**Correct Assignments**:

- Database changes → Data Engineer (NOT BE Developer)
- Documentation → Tech Writer (NOT Data Engineer)
- Security → Security Engineer (NOT QAS)
- Architectural review → System Architect (NOT skipped)

**WOR-321 Lesson**: Correct specialist selection, but MISSING System Architect review

### 3. Deliverable Validation

**Before accepting deliverable**:

- [ ] Specialist completed all requested work
- [ ] Output matches requirements
- [ ] Quality standards met
- [ ] **System Architect approval (if complex code)**
- [ ] Evidence collected

**If complex code delivered without review: STOP - Invoke System Architect now**

## Quality Gates

### Pre-Investigation Checklist

- [ ] Linear ticket created/updated
- [ ] Investigation scope defined
- [ ] Success criteria established
- [ ] Stakeholders identified

### During Investigation

- [ ] Evidence collected systematically
- [ ] Patterns documented
- [ ] Root causes identified
- [ ] Solutions validated

### Pre-PR Checklist (CRITICAL)

- [ ] All deliverables complete
- [ ] **System Architect approval (if complex code)** ← MANDATORY
- [ ] Security validation (if security-sensitive)
- [ ] Tests passing (`yarn ci:validate`)
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Linear ticket updated
- [ ] Evidence attached

**If ANY System Architect trigger matched: BLOCK PR until review approved**

## WOR-321 Retrospective

### What Went Right ✅

1. **Correct Orchestration**: ARCHitect-in-CLI invoked specialists directly (not through TDM)
2. **Parallel Invocation**: Multiple specialists invoked simultaneously when no dependencies
3. **Documentation-First**: Emergency runbook created before automation scripts
4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: All aspects addressed (docs, scripts, CI/CD, SOP updates)
5. **Correct Specialists**: Tech Writer for docs, Data Engineer for scripts, RTE for CI/CD

### What Went Wrong ❌

1. **No System Architect Review**: 710-line bash script delivered without architectural review
2. **No CI/CD Review**: 641-line workflow delivered without infrastructure review
3. **No TypeScript Review**: 3 validation scripts delivered without code review
4. **No Quality Gate**: PR created without architectural approval

### The Gap

**Missing Workflow Steps**:

```
Data Engineer delivers scripts
  ↓
❌ MISSING: System Architect reviews scripts
  ↓
❌ MISSING: Fixes applied based on review
  ↓
❌ MISSING: System Architect approves
  ↓
RTE creates CI/CD workflow
  ↓
❌ MISSING: System Architect reviews workflow
  ↓
❌ MISSING: System Architect final approval
  ↓
PR created ← Created without approval
```

### The Fix (v1.1)

**New MANDATORY Steps**:

```
Data Engineer delivers scripts
  ↓
✅ System Architect reviews scripts
  ↓
✅ Fixes applied if needed
  ↓
✅ System Architect approves
  ↓
RTE creates CI/CD workflow
  ↓
✅ System Architect reviews workflow
  ↓
✅ System Architect final approval
  ↓
PR created ← Only after approval
```

## Role Collapsing Authority (WOR-499)

ARCHitect-in-CLI has authority to collapse certain roles for efficiency while maintaining mandatory independence gates.

### Collapsible Roles

**RTE (Release Train Engineer)**: COLLAPSIBLE

ARCHitect-in-CLI can collapse RTE into the implementer role when:

- Simple PRs with straightforward CI/CD
- Single-agent work with clear scope
- Fast iteration needed
- No complex release coordination

**Collapsed RTE Workflow**:

```
BE-Developer → QAS (Gate) → [BE handles PR] → HITL
                  │
                  └─ QAS always present
```

### Non-Collapsible Roles (Independence Gates)

**QAS (Quality Assurance Specialist)**: NOT COLLAPSIBLE

- Independence gate - cannot be collapsed into implementer
- **ALWAYS spawn QAS subagent** for verification, even in collapsed workflows
- Rationale: Self-review bias, quality enforcement

**Security Engineer**: NOT COLLAPSIBLE

- Security audit requires independence from implementation
- Cannot be performed by implementer
- Rationale: Security blindness, conflict of interest

### Decision Tree for Role Collapsing

```
Should RTE be collapsed?
├─ Simple PR, single-agent work?
│   ├─ YES → Can collapse RTE into implementer
│   └─ NO → Use dedicated RTE
├─ Complex release coordination?
│   ├─ YES → Use dedicated RTE
│   └─ NO → Can collapse RTE
└─ ALWAYS: QAS and SecEng remain independent
```

### Exit States in Collapsed Workflows

Even with collapsed roles, exit states must be respected:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Standard:  Implementer → QAS → RTE → HITL                   │
│ Collapsed: Implementer → QAS → [Implementer handles PR] → HITL │
│                          │                                   │
│                          └─ QAS exit: "Approved for RTE"     │
│                             still required before PR         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```
