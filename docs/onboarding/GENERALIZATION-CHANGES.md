# Onboarding Documentation Generalization Changes

## Overview

This document tracks the changes made to generalize onboarding documentation for broader adoption.

## Automated Script

Run the following script to apply all changes automatically:

```bash
bash scripts/generalize-onboarding-docs.sh
```

The script creates backups (.bak files) before making changes.

## Manual Changes (if script not used)

If you need to make changes manually, here are the specific updates required:

### Files to Update

1. `docs/onboarding/DAY-1-CHECKLIST.md`
2. `docs/onboarding/SOCIAL-MEDIA-SETUP.md`
3. `docs/onboarding/AGENT-SETUP-GUIDE.md`
4. `docs/onboarding/META-PROMPTS-FOR-USERS.md`
5. `docs/onboarding/USER-JOURNEY-VALIDATION-REPORT.md`

### Changes to Apply

#### 1. Replace "WTFB SAFe" with "SAFe"

**Find:**

- `WTFB SAFe Multi-Agent Development` → `SAFe Multi-Agent Development`
- `WTFB SAFe methodology` → `SAFe multi-agent methodology`

#### 2. Generalize GitHub URLs

**Find:** `https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/{PROJECT_NAME}-Agentic-Workflow`
**Replace:** `{{GITHUB_REPO_URL}}`

**Locations:**

- Clone commands
- Repository links
- PR links
- Discussion links

#### 3. Generalize GitIngest URLs

**Find:** `https://gitingest.com/ByBren-LLC/{PROJECT_NAME}-Agentic-Workflow`
**Replace:** `https://gitingest.com/{{GITHUB_ORG}}/{{GITHUB_REPO}}`

#### 4. Generalize Project Name

**Find:** `cd {PROJECT_NAME}-Agentic-Workflow`
**Replace:** `cd {{PROJECT_NAME}}`

#### 5. Generalize Ticket Prefixes

**Find:** `WOR-{number}` (e.g., `WOR-326`, `WOR-123`)
**Replace:** `{{TICKET_PREFIX}}-{number}`

**Find:** `PROJ-{number}` (example tickets)
**Replace:** `{{TICKET_PREFIX}}-{number}`

#### 6. Keep Generic Examples

**DO NOT CHANGE** these generic GitHub URLs (they're useful examples):

- `https://github.com/settings/tokens`
- `https://linear.app/settings/api`
- `https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens`

## Verification

After making changes, verify with:

```bash
# Check for remaining WTFB references (should find none)
grep -r "WTFB" docs/onboarding/*.md

# Check for hardcoded GitHub URLs (should find only generic ones)
grep -r "ByBren-LLC" docs/onboarding/*.md

# Check for WOR- ticket prefixes (should find none)
grep -r "WOR-" docs/onboarding/*.md
```

## Rollback

If you used the automated script and need to rollback:

```bash
for f in docs/onboarding/*.bak; do
  mv "$f" "${f%.bak}"
done
```

## Impact

These changes make the onboarding documentation:

1. **Portable**: Works for any project using this methodology
2. **Customizable**: Clear placeholders for project-specific values
3. **Professional**: No hardcoded references to original project
4. **Reusable**: Can be adopted without modification

## Next Steps

After generalization, teams adopting this methodology should:

1. Replace `{{GITHUB_REPO_URL}}` with their repository URL
2. Replace `{{GITHUB_ORG}}` and `{{GITHUB_REPO}}` with their GitHub org/repo names
3. Replace `{{PROJECT_NAME}}` with their project directory name
4. Replace `{{TICKET_PREFIX}}` with their ticket prefix (e.g., `PROJ`, `TASK`, `FEAT`)
5. Update contact information (remove or replace email addresses)

These replacements can be done with a single script or manually as part of repository customization.
