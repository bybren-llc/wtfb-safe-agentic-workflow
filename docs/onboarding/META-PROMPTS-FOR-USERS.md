## 1. Initial Setup Meta-Prompt

**When to use**: First time setting up the WTFB SAFe methodology in your project.

**Copy-paste this to your AI assistant**:

```
I want to set up the WTFB SAFe Multi-Agent Development methodology in my project. I've cloned the repository from https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-SAFe-Agentic-Workflow.

Please help me with the following:

1. **Agent Provider Selection**: I'm using [Claude Code / Augment Code / Other]. What do I need to do to install the 11 agent prompts?

2. **Agent Files**: I see agent files in two locations:
   - `.claude/agents/` (11 files)
   - `agent_providers/claude_code/prompts/` (11 files)

   Which directory should I use, and how do I install them?

3. **Environment Setup**: The implementation guide mentions `.env.template` but I don't see it in the repository. What environment variables do I need to configure?

4. **First Steps**: After installing agents, what should I do first to validate the setup is working?

5. **Template Customization**: I see placeholders like {{PROJECT_NAME}}, {{TICKET_PREFIX}}, etc. Can you help me identify all placeholders I need to replace and where to find them?

My project details:
- Project name: [YOUR_PROJECT_NAME]
- Ticket system: [Linear / Jira / GitHub Issues]
- Primary development branch: [main / dev / develop]
- Tech stack: [YOUR_TECH_STACK]
- Team size: [NUMBER] developers

Please provide step-by-step instructions for getting started.
```

**Expected outcome**: Your AI assistant will guide you through initial setup with project-specific instructions.

## 2. Agent Role Selection Meta-Prompt

**When to use**: When you need to decide which agent to invoke for a specific task.

**Copy-paste this to your AI assistant**:

```
I'm working on a task and need to know which WTFB SAFe agent to invoke. Here's my task:

**Task Description**: [DESCRIBE YOUR TASK]

**Task Type**: [Feature / Bug Fix / Refactor / Documentation / Testing / Security / Infrastructure]

**Complexity**: [Simple / Medium / Complex]

**Areas Involved**: [Frontend / Backend / Database / API / Testing / Documentation / Security]

Based on the WTFB SAFe methodology with 11 agent roles:
1. TDM (Technical Delivery Manager)
2. BSA (Business Systems Analyst)
3. System Architect
4. FE Developer (Frontend)
5. BE Developer (Backend)
6. DE (Data Engineer)
7. TW (Technical Writer)
8. DPE (Data Provisioning Engineer)
9. QAS (Quality Assurance Specialist)
10. SecEng (Security Engineer)
11. RTE (Release Train Engineer)

Please recommend:
1. Which agent(s) should I invoke for this task?
2. In what order should I invoke them?
3. What should I ask each agent to do?
4. What success criteria should I use to validate each agent's work?

Reference: See AGENTS.md in the repository for agent role descriptions.
```

**Expected outcome**: Clear guidance on which agent(s) to use and in what sequence.

## 3. First Linear Ticket Meta-Prompt

**When to use**: Creating your first Linear ticket using the SAFe methodology.

**Copy-paste this to your AI assistant**:

```
I want to create my first Linear ticket using the WTFB SAFe methodology. I'm ready to invoke the BSA (Business Systems Analyst) agent.

**Feature Request**: [DESCRIBE YOUR FEATURE]

**Business Value**: [WHY THIS FEATURE MATTERS]

**User Impact**: [WHO BENEFITS AND HOW]

Please help me:

1. **User Story Format**: Convert my feature request into a proper user story format:
   - As a [USER_TYPE]
   - I want to [ACTION]
   - So that [BENEFIT]

2. **Acceptance Criteria**: Define clear, testable acceptance criteria (Given/When/Then format preferred)

3. **Testing Strategy**: Outline what types of tests are needed:
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - E2E tests
   - Manual testing steps

4. **Technical Considerations**: Identify:
   - Which parts of the codebase will be affected
   - What patterns from the pattern library might apply
   - What security considerations exist
   - What database changes might be needed

5. **Ticket Structure**: Format this as a Linear ticket with:
   - Title: [TICKET_PREFIX]-XXX: [Short description]
   - Description: User story + context
   - Acceptance Criteria: Numbered list
   - Testing Strategy: Detailed plan
   - Technical Notes: Architecture considerations

Reference the BSA agent prompt at `.claude/agents/bsa.md` for the complete workflow.
```

**Expected outcome**: A complete Linear ticket ready to be created, following SAFe best practices.

## 4. Template Customization Meta-Prompt

**When to use**: When you need to customize the repository templates for your project.

**Copy-paste this to your AI assistant**:

```
I've cloned the WTFB SAFe Agentic Workflow repository and need to customize it for my project. I see several template placeholders that need to be replaced.

**My Project Details**:
- Project Name: [YOUR_PROJECT_NAME]
- GitHub Organization: [YOUR_ORG]
- Repository Name: [YOUR_REPO]
- Ticket Prefix: [YOUR_PREFIX] (e.g., PROJ, TEAM, etc.)
- Primary Dev Branch: [main / dev / develop]
- Architect GitHub Handle: [YOUR_GITHUB_HANDLE]
- Confluence URL: [YOUR_CONFLUENCE_URL or N/A]
- Database Superuser Role: [YOUR_DB_SUPERUSER_ROLE]
- Database App User Role: [YOUR_DB_APP_USER_ROLE]

Please help me:

1. **Find All Placeholders**: Search the repository for all instances of:
   - {{PROJECT_NAME}}
   - {{TICKET_PREFIX}}
   - {{PRIMARY_DEV_BRANCH}}
   - {{ARCHITECT_GITHUB_HANDLE}}
   - {{CONFLUENCE_URL}}
   - {{DB_SUPERUSER_ROLE}}
   - {{DB_APP_USER_ROLE}}
   - Any other {{PLACEHOLDERS}}

2. **Replacement Plan**: Create a find-and-replace plan showing:
   - File path
   - Line number
   - Old value (placeholder)
   - New value (my project-specific value)

3. **Validation**: After replacement, what should I check to ensure everything is configured correctly?

4. **Git Strategy**: Should I:
   - Replace placeholders in a single commit?
   - Create a branch for customization?
   - Keep placeholders and use environment variables?

Please provide a systematic approach to customizing this template repository.
```

**Expected outcome**: Complete customization plan with all placeholders identified and replacement strategy.
