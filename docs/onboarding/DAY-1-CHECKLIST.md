# Day 1 Checklist: WTFB SAFe Multi-Agent Development

**Purpose**: Your first day with the WTFB SAFe methodology - complete this checklist to validate your setup.

**Time Estimate**: 2-3 hours

**Prerequisites**:

- Access to Claude Code or Augment Code
- Linear/Jira account with API access
- GitHub account with repository access
- Basic understanding of SAFe principles (optional but helpful)

---

## Phase 1: Repository Setup (30 minutes)

### Step 1.1: Clone Repository

```bash
# Clone the template repository
git clone https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-SAFe-Agentic-Workflow
cd WTFB-SAFe-Agentic-Workflow

# Explore the structure
ls -la
cat README.md
```

**Validation**:

- [ ] Repository cloned successfully
- [ ] Can see `.claude/agents/` directory
- [ ] Can see `whitepaper/` directory
- [ ] Can see `AGENTS.md` file

---

### Step 1.2: Load Repository Context (Optional but Recommended)

**Option A: Use GitIngest** (Recommended)

1. Visit: https://gitingest.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-SAFe-Agentic-Workflow
2. Copy the generated context
3. Paste into your AI assistant (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.)
4. Ask: "Explain the WTFB SAFe methodology in 3 paragraphs"

**Option B: Read Documentation**

1. Read: `README.md` (5 min)
2. Read: `AGENTS.md` (10 min)
3. Read: `whitepaper/section-1-executive-summary.md` (5 min)

**Validation**:

- [ ] Understand the 11 agent roles
- [ ] Understand the SAFe workflow (Epic → Feature → Story)
- [ ] Understand the "Search First, Reuse Always" philosophy

---

## Phase 2: Agent Provider Setup (30 minutes)

### Step 2.1: Choose Your Agent Provider

**Option A: Claude Code** (Recommended)

- Best for: Teams using Claude API
- Installation: https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/claude-code
- Agent files location: `.claude/agents/`

**Option B: Augment Code**

- Best for: Teams using Augment
- Installation: https://www.augmentcode.com/
- Agent files location: `agent_providers/augment/`

**Decision**:

- [ ] I'm using: [Claude Code / Augment Code / Other]

---

### Step 2.2: Install Agent Prompts

**For Claude Code**:

```bash
# Option 1: Copy to user directory (single user)
cp -r .claude/agents/* ~/.claude/agents/

# Option 2: Use in-project (team sharing)
# Agents are already in .claude/agents/ - no action needed
# Claude Code will auto-detect them
```

**For Augment Code**:

```bash
# Copy Augment-specific configurations
cp -r agent_providers/augment/* ~/.augment/
```

**Validation**:

- [ ] Agent files copied to correct location
- [ ] Can see 11 agent files (bsa.md, system-architect.md, etc.)
- [ ] Agent provider recognizes the agents

---

### Step 2.3: Verify Agent Installation

**Test Agent Invocation**:

1. Open your agent provider (Claude Code or Augment)
2. Try to invoke the BSA agent
3. Ask: "What is your role as the BSA agent?"

**Expected Response**: The agent should respond with its role description from the agent prompt file.

**Validation**:

- [ ] Agent responds with correct role description
- [ ] Agent mentions "Business Systems Analyst"
- [ ] Agent mentions "pattern discovery" and "acceptance criteria"

---

## Phase 3: Tool Integration (30 minutes)

### Step 3.1: Linear/Jira Setup

**Linear Setup**:

```bash
# Get your Linear API key
# Visit: https://linear.app/settings/api

# Set environment variable (add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc)
export LINEAR_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

# Test Linear access
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $LINEAR_API_KEY" \
  https://api.linear.app/graphql \
  -d '{"query": "{ viewer { id name } }"}'
```

**Jira Setup** (Alternative):

```bash
# Get your Jira API token
# Visit: https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens

export JIRA_API_TOKEN="your_token_here"
export JIRA_EMAIL="your_email@example.com"
export JIRA_DOMAIN="your-domain.atlassian.net"
```

**Validation**:

- [ ] API key/token obtained
- [ ] Environment variable set
- [ ] API access tested successfully

---

### Step 3.2: GitHub Setup

```bash
# Get your GitHub Personal Access Token
# Visit: https://github.com/settings/tokens
# Scopes needed: repo, workflow, write:packages

export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_github_token_here"

# Test GitHub access
gh auth status
```

**Validation**:

- [ ] GitHub token obtained
- [ ] Environment variable set
- [ ] GitHub CLI authenticated

---

### Step 3.3: Configure Project Settings

**Create your project configuration**:

```bash
# Copy template (if it exists)
cp .env.template .env 2>/dev/null || touch .env

# Edit .env with your values
cat > .env << EOF
# Project Configuration
PROJECT_NAME="YourProjectName"
TICKET_PREFIX="PROJ"
PRIMARY_DEV_BRANCH="main"
ARCHITECT_GITHUB_HANDLE="your-github-handle"

# API Keys
LINEAR_API_KEY="$LINEAR_API_KEY"
GITHUB_TOKEN="$GITHUB_TOKEN"

# Optional
CONFLUENCE_URL="https://your-domain.atlassian.net/wiki"
EOF
```

**Validation**:

- [ ] `.env` file created
- [ ] All required variables set
- [ ] File added to `.gitignore` (security)

---

## Phase 4: First Agent Workflow (45 minutes)

### Step 4.1: Create Your First Linear Ticket

**Invoke BSA Agent**:

```
I want to create a test Linear ticket to validate my WTFB SAFe setup.

Feature: Add a "Hello World" endpoint to validate the agent workflow.

Please help me:
1. Create a user story in proper format
2. Define acceptance criteria
3. Outline testing strategy
4. Suggest which agents to invoke for implementation

Use the BSA agent workflow from .claude/agents/bsa.md
```

**Expected Output**:

- User story in "As a... I want... So that..." format
- 3-5 testable acceptance criteria
- Testing strategy (unit, integration, E2E)
- Agent invocation sequence

**Validation**:

- [ ] BSA agent created proper user story
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are testable
- [ ] Testing strategy is comprehensive
- [ ] Agent sequence makes sense

---

### Step 4.2: Create Linear Ticket

**Manual Creation** (for now):

1. Go to Linear: https://linear.app
2. Create new issue
3. Title: `PROJ-1: Add Hello World endpoint for agent workflow validation`
4. Description: Paste BSA output
5. Add acceptance criteria
6. Add testing strategy

**Validation**:

- [ ] Linear ticket created
- [ ] Ticket has proper format (PROJ-1)
- [ ] All BSA output included
- [ ] Ticket is in "Backlog" or "Ready" state

---

### Step 4.3: Implement with Agent

**Invoke Backend Developer Agent**:

```
I'm implementing Linear ticket PROJ-1: Add Hello World endpoint.

User Story:
[PASTE USER STORY FROM BSA]

Acceptance Criteria:
[PASTE ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA]

Please help me:
1. Search for existing API endpoint patterns in the codebase
2. Implement the Hello World endpoint following existing patterns
3. Write tests according to the testing strategy
4. Validate the implementation meets all acceptance criteria

Use the BE Developer agent workflow from .claude/agents/be-developer.md
```

**Expected Output**:

- Pattern discovery results
- Implementation code
- Test code
- Validation that ACs are met

**Validation**:

- [ ] Agent searched for patterns first
- [ ] Implementation follows existing patterns
- [ ] Tests are comprehensive
- [ ] All acceptance criteria addressed

---

### Step 4.4: Create Pull Request

**Create Feature Branch**:

```bash
git checkout -b PROJ-1-hello-world-endpoint
git add .
git commit -m "feat(api): add Hello World endpoint [PROJ-1]

- Add GET /api/hello endpoint
- Return JSON with message and timestamp
- Add unit and integration tests
- Update API documentation

Closes PROJ-1"
git push origin PROJ-1-hello-world-endpoint
```

**Create PR**:

```bash
# Using GitHub CLI
gh pr create \
  --title "feat(api): add Hello World endpoint [PROJ-1]" \
  --body "Implements PROJ-1

## Changes
- Add GET /api/hello endpoint
- Add tests
- Update docs

## Testing
- Unit tests pass
- Integration tests pass
- Manual testing completed

## Linear Ticket

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Agent not found

- **Solution**: Verify agent files are in correct directory (`~/.claude/agents/` or `.claude/agents/`)

**Issue**: Agent doesn't respond correctly

- **Solution**: Check agent prompt file has correct frontmatter (name, description, tools, model)

**Issue**: Linear API fails

- **Solution**: Verify API key is correct and has proper permissions

**Issue**: Pattern discovery returns no results

- **Solution**: Ensure patterns_library/ directory exists and has content

**Issue**: PR creation fails

- **Solution**: Verify GitHub token has `repo` and `workflow` scopes
