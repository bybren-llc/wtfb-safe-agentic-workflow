# Agent Workflow Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)

**Purpose**: Define standard workflows for agent invocation and coordination

**Version**: 1.1 (Added System Architect Review Method)
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-06

---

## Overview

This SOP defines four standard methods for agent workflow coordination:

1. **Method 1**: Direct Specialist Invocation (simple tasks)
2. **Method 2**: TDM Orchestration (standard features)
3. **Method 3**: ARCHitect-in-CLI Orchestration (complex investigations)
4. **Method 4**: System Architect Review for Complex Code (NEW - v1.1)

---

## Method 1: Direct Specialist Invocation

**When to Use**: Simple, focused tasks requiring single specialist

**Examples**:

- Documentation updates
- Simple bug fixes
- Configuration changes
- Single-file modifications

### Workflow

```
ARCHitect-in-CLI
└─ Specialist (Complete work)
```

### Steps

1. **Identify Specialist**: Determine correct specialist for task
2. **Invoke Specialist**: Provide clear requirements and context
3. **Validate Deliverable**: Ensure work meets requirements
4. **Create PR**: If all quality gates pass

### Quality Gates

- [ ] Specialist completed all requested work
- [ ] Output matches requirements
- [ ] Tests passing (if applicable)
- [ ] Documentation updated (if applicable)

---

## Method 2: TDM Orchestration

**When to Use**: Standard feature development with multiple specialists

**Examples**:

- New feature implementation
- Multi-component changes
- Cross-team coordination
- Standard user stories

### Workflow

```
ARCHitect-in-CLI
└─ TDM (Orchestrator)
    ├─ BSA (Requirements/Spec)
    ├─ Specialist (Implementation)
    ├─ QAS (Testing)
    └─ RTE (PR Creation)
```

### Steps

1. **Invoke TDM**: Provide feature requirements and context
2. **TDM Coordinates**: TDM invokes appropriate specialists
3. **Validate Deliverables**: TDM ensures all work complete
4. **Create PR**: RTE creates PR after all validations

### Quality Gates

- [ ] All specialists completed tasks
- [ ] Handoffs documented
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] Evidence attached to Linear

---

## Method 3: ARCHitect-in-CLI Orchestration

**When to Use**: Complex investigations requiring multiple specialists with dependencies

**Examples**:

- Root cause analysis
- Complex automation creation
- Multi-specialist coordination
- Investigation-driven work

### Workflow

```
ARCHitect-in-CLI (Orchestrator)
├─ Specialist 1 (Parallel if independent)
├─ Specialist 2 (Parallel if independent)
├─ Specialist 3 (Sequential if dependent)
└─ System Architect (Review if complex code) ← See Method 4
```

### Steps

1. **Define Investigation Scope**: Clear objectives and success criteria
2. **Identify Specialists**: Determine all required specialists
3. **Coordinate Invocations**: Parallel for independent work, sequential for dependencies
4. **Validate Deliverables**: Ensure all outputs meet requirements
5. **System Architect Review**: MANDATORY if complex code created (see Method 4)
6. **Create PR**: Only after all validations and reviews

### Quality Gates

- [ ] All specialists invoked correctly
- [ ] Parallel/sequential coordination optimal
- [ ] All deliverables validated
- [ ] **System Architect review (if complex code)** ← CRITICAL
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Evidence attached to Linear

---

## Method 4: System Architect Review for Complex Code

**When to Use**: Complex automation/infrastructure code created during investigation

**MANDATORY Triggers**:

- Bash scripts >100 lines
- CI/CD workflow changes
- Infrastructure automation
- Database migration scripts
- Security-critical code
- TypeScript/JavaScript >200 lines

### Step 1: Complete Specialist Work

Invoke specialist (Data Engineer, RTE, etc.) to create deliverable:

```typescript
Task({
  subagent_type: "data-engineer",
  description: "Create production deployment script",
  prompt: `Create automated deployment script for production migrations.

Requirements:
- SSH to production server via Tailscale
- Execute migration via Docker
- Comprehensive error handling
- Rollback capability
- Validation checks

Context: [Investigation findings, requirements, constraints]`,
});
```

### Step 2: System Architect Review (MANDATORY)

After specialist delivers complex code, invoke System Architect:

```typescript
Task({
  subagent_type: "system-architect",
  description: "Review deployment automation",
  prompt: `Architectural review required for WOR-XXX deliverables.

Files to Review:
- scripts/deploy-migration-prod.sh (710 lines bash)
- scripts/pre-migration-audit.ts (TypeScript with Prisma)
- scripts/validate-migration-rls.ts (TypeScript pre-commit hook)
- .github/workflows/migration-validation.yml (641 lines CI/CD)

Review Criteria:
1. Architectural patterns and consistency
2. Security best practices (SSH, Docker, credentials)
3. Error handling and edge cases
4. Code quality and maintainability
5. Documentation completeness

Decision Required:
- [ ] APPROVED: Ready for PR with recommendations
- [ ] REQUIRES FIXES: Detailed issues list

Context:
[What automation does, why needed, production impact]

Reference: WOR-XXX investigation findings`,
});
```

### Step 3: Address Review Feedback

If System Architect requires fixes:

1. **Invoke specialist again** with System Architect feedback
2. **Implement fixes** addressing all issues
3. **Re-submit to System Architect** for re-review
4. **Repeat until approved**

Example:

```typescript
Task({
  subagent_type: "data-engineer",
  description: "Address System Architect feedback on deployment script",
  prompt: `System Architect review identified the following issues:

1. Missing error handling for SSH connection failures
2. Hardcoded credentials (should use environment variables)
3. No rollback mechanism for failed migrations
4. Insufficient logging for debugging

Please update scripts/deploy-migration-prod.sh to address all issues.

Original script: [Attach current version]
System Architect feedback: [Full review comments]`,
});
```

### Step 4: Create PR (Only After Approval)

Once System Architect approves:

1. **Document architectural decisions** (ADR if needed)
2. **Update Linear ticket** with review approval
3. **Create PR** with System Architect approval noted in description
4. **Attach evidence** (review approval, test results)

### Example: WOR-321 Gap

**Missing Steps**: System Architect review NOT invoked

**What Should Have Happened**:

1. Data Engineer delivered scripts ✅
2. **System Architect reviewed scripts** ❌ (MISSING)
3. **Fixes applied based on review** ❌ (MISSING)
4. **System Architect approved** ❌ (MISSING)
5. RTE created CI/CD workflow ✅
6. **System Architect reviewed workflow** ❌ (MISSING)
7. **System Architect final approval** ❌ (MISSING)
8. PR created ❌ (Created without approval)

**Lesson**: **Never skip architectural review for complex code**

## Workflow Selection Guide

### Decision Tree

```
What type of work?
├─ Simple task, single specialist → Method 1
├─ Standard feature, multiple specialists → Method 2
├─ Complex investigation, multiple specialists → Method 3
└─ Complex code created? → Method 4 (MANDATORY)
```

- Single file changes
- Documentation updates
- Configuration tweaks
- Bug fixes <50 lines

**Standard** (Method 2):

- Feature implementation
