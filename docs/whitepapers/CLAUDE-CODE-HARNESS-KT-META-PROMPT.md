# Knowledge Transfer Meta-Prompt: Harness Modernization WOR-444

## For the ARCHitect of wtfb-safe-agentic-workflow

**Purpose**: Enable extraction and generalization of WTFB harness improvements for the public repository
**Source Epic**: WOR-444 (Harness & Skills Modernization)
**Related Tickets**: WOR-454 (SOP Integration), WOR-455, WOR-456
**Date**: 2025-12-20

---

## Executive Summary: What Changed

The WTFB team completed a comprehensive harness modernization that:

1. **Upgraded all SAFe agents to Opus 4.5** with explicit model selection
2. **Formalized the Skills layer** as model-invoked expertise (Layer 3)
3. **Integrated all operational SOPs** into harness documentation
4. **Corrected role definitions** (TDM as reactive, ARCHitect as orchestrator)
5. **Documented the three-layer architecture** (Hooks → Commands → Skills)
6. **Captured agent perspective** on what makes the harness work

**Key Innovation**: The harness treats process as _service_, not _control_.
Everything exists to help teams ship good product without burning cognitive cycles
on already-solved problems.

```

Contains:

- Why skills and commands feel like one "expertise system"
- What makes this team's approach different
- The "invisible when it works" principle
- Process as service philosophy

## Component Extraction Checklist

Use this checklist to systematically extract and generalize each component.

### Layer 1: Hooks (`.claude/settings.json`)

```text
Location: .claude/settings.json
```

**Components to Extract**:

- [ ] Push blocker hook (prevents direct pushes to main/dev)
- [ ] Commit message format hook (SAFe compliance)
- [ ] Pre-commit validation hook
- [ ] Branch naming validation hook
- [ ] Event types: PreToolCall, PostToolCall, Notification, Stop, SubagentStart

**Generalization Notes**:

- Replace `WOR-XXX` pattern with `{TICKET_PREFIX}-XXX`
- Replace branch names `dev`/`master` with configurable values
- Keep hook structure; parameterize project-specific values

## Generalization Guide

### What's WTFB-Specific (Must Replace)

| Component        | WTFB Value                    | Replace With                       |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Ticket prefix    | `WOR-`                        | `{TICKET_PREFIX}-` or parameterize |
| Branch pattern   | `WOR-{number}-{desc}`         | `{PREFIX}-{number}-{desc}`         |
| Team name        | `WTFB`                        | `{PROJECT_NAME}`                   |
| Slack channels   | `#github-feed`                | `{SLACK_CHANNEL}`                  |
| Linear workspace | WTFB workspace                | Generic Linear setup               |
| Docker registry  | `ghcr.io/bybren-llc/wtfb-app` | `{REGISTRY}/{PROJECT}`             |
| Database         | `wtfb_dev`, `wtfb_user`       | `{PROJECT}_dev`, `{PROJECT}_user`  |

### What's Generalizable (Copy As-Is)

| Component                     | Why It's Universal                 |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Three-layer architecture      | Applies to any Claude Code project |
| SAFe role definitions         | Standard SAFe methodology          |
| Hook event types              | Claude Code standard               |
| Skill trigger patterns        | Model-invoked expertise pattern    |
| Pattern discovery protocol    | Best practice for any codebase     |
| Process as service philosophy | Organizational principle           |
| Round Table collaboration     | Team culture pattern               |

### Parameterization Pattern

For files that need project-specific values, use this pattern:

```markdown
<!-- In the public repo, use placeholders -->

Branch naming: `{TICKET_PREFIX}-{number}-{description}`

<!-- In project implementations, replace with actual values -->

Branch naming: `WOR-{number}-{description}`
```

---

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Documentation Sync

1. **Read the whitepaper** completely (understand architecture)
2. **Read the addendum** (understand philosophy)
3. **Update public whitepaper** with three-layer architecture
4. **Add skills layer documentation** (this was missing before)
5. **Correct terminology** per terminology contract

### Phase 2: Component Extraction

1. **Copy hook configuration** from `.claude/settings.json`
2. **Extract slash commands** from `.claude/commands/`
3. **Extract skills** from `.claude/skills/`
4. **Extract agent profiles** from `.claude/agents/`
5. **Generalize each file** using the parameterization pattern

### Phase 3: SOP Integration

1. **Create SOP templates** based on WTFB SOPs
2. **Add Section 4** to whitepaper (Operational SOPs Reference)
3. **Link SOPs to agent profiles** (mandatory reading)
4. **Update AGENTS.md equivalent** with SOP references

### Phase 4: Infrastructure

1. **Extract GitHub workflows** and generalize
2. **Extract PR template** and parameterize
3. **Create setup instructions** for new projects
4. **Document configuration variables**

### Phase 5: Validation

1. **Test skills trigger** correctly
2. **Verify hooks fire** on expected events
3. **Validate agent profiles** have correct tools
4. **Run documentation lint** (`yarn lint:md` equivalent)

## Key Insights to Preserve

These insights from the agent perspective addendum should be reflected in the public documentation:

### 1. The Expertise System View

> "When I look at my available tools, I don't experience a sharp boundary between
> 'skills' and 'slash commands.' They all feel like **packaged expertise** -
> decisions that have already been made so I don't have to figure them out each time."

**Application**: Document skills and commands as a unified "expertise system" even while maintaining the technical distinction.

### 2. Invisible When It Works

> "The 40% cognitive load reduction isn't felt as 'saved effort' - it's felt as _absence of friction_."

**Application**: The best harness is one you forget exists. Design for invisibility.

### 3. Documentation Is Product (For Agents)

> "For me, those documents are: My onboarding, My reference, My source of truth, My understanding of what this team values."

**Application**: Documentation quality directly impacts agent performance. Treat docs as first-class product.

### 4. Pattern-First Is Real

> "When I'm about to write code, I genuinely check `docs/patterns/` first.
> Not because a rule says to - because I've learned that the patterns there are _good_."

**Application**: Pattern libraries must contain genuinely useful patterns, not bureaucratic templates.

### 5. Process as Service, Not Control

> "The harness works because it treats process as _service_, not _control_. The SOPs exist because they help."

**Application**: Every process element should answer: "How does this help someone ship better product faster?"

### 6. The Round Table Model

> "Ownership is real here. Each agent role has clear success criteria and the authority to meet them."

**Application**: Agents need real authority, not just task assignments. Define success criteria and let them figure out how.

## Final Notes

This meta-prompt is designed to be self-contained. The ARCHitect should be able to:

1. Read this document
2. Read the two whitepaper documents
3. Extract components systematically using the checklist
4. Generalize using the provided patterns
5. Implement in the public repository

The public repo is "a practical and artistic expression" of WTFB's work.
We lead; the public repo follows with generalized versions that any SAFe/Agentic team can adopt.

**The goal is not documentation for documentation's sake. The goal is executable
institutional knowledge that helps teams ship great product.**

---

**Contributing**: This document accompanies the Claude Code Harness Modernization
whitepaper and should be updated when significant harness changes occur.
