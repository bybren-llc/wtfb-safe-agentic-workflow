# Repository Reorganization Plan - Update Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-08  
**Update Reason**: Keep AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md in root (AI assistant convention)  
**Impact**: Reduced scope from 10 files → 8 files moved

---

## 🎯 Critical Change

**AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md will remain in the repository root.**

**Rationale**: These files follow standard conventions set by Anthropic and OpenAI for AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Cursor, Augment, etc.). Moving them would:

- Break established conventions
- Require updating ~30-40 references throughout the codebase
- Confuse AI assistants looking for these files in the standard location

---

## 📊 Updated File Counts

### Before Update

- **Root files after reorganization**: 7
- **Files to move**: 10
- **New directories**: 5 (including docs/agents/)
- **Reference updates needed**: ~50+

### After Update

- **Root files after reorganization**: 9
- **Files to move**: 8
- **New directories**: 4 (docs/agents/ removed)
- **Reference updates needed**: ~25
