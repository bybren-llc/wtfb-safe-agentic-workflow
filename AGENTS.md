## Success Validation Commands

### Frontend Development

```bash
npm run type-check && npm run lint && npm run build && echo "FE SUCCESS" || echo "FE FAILED"
```

### Backend Development

```bash
npm run test:integration && echo "BE SUCCESS" || echo "BE FAILED"
```

### Documentation

```bash
npm run lint:md && echo "DOCS SUCCESS" || echo "DOCS FAILED"
```

### Pre-Push Validation

```bash
npm run ci:validate && echo "CI SUCCESS" || echo "CI FAILED"
```

### Database Migration

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name migration_name && echo "MIGRATION SUCCESS" || echo "MIGRATION FAILED"
```

## SAFe Specs-Driven Workflow

### Planning Phase (BSA)

```bash
# Large initiative → Use planning template
cp specs_templates/planning_template.md specs/{feature}-planning.md
# Fill with Epic → Features → Stories → Enablers

# User story → Use spec template
cp specs_templates/spec_template.md specs/{TICKET_PREFIX}-XXX-{feature}-spec.md
# Fill with implementation details
```

### Execution Phase (All Agents)

```bash
# 1. Read spec for clear goal
cat specs/{TICKET_PREFIX}-XXX-{feature}-spec.md

# 2. Extract:
# - User story (goal)
# - Acceptance criteria (success)
# - Low-level tasks (steps)
# - Demo script (validation)

# 3. Implement using Simon's loop:
# - Clear goal from spec
# - Pattern discovery (codebase + specs)
# - Iterate until demo script passes
# - Escalate if blocked
```

## Pattern Discovery Protocol (MANDATORY)

### 0. Search Specs Directory (FIRST)

```bash
# Find similar implementations in specs
ls specs/*-spec.md | grep "similar_feature"

# Review SAFe user stories
grep -r "As a.*I want to" specs/

# Check patterns from past specs
cat specs/XXX-similar-spec.md
```

### 1. Search Codebase

```bash
# Search for similar functionality
grep -r "feature_name|functionality" app/

# Find existing helpers
ls lib/ && grep -r "helper_pattern" lib/

# Check components
grep -r "component_pattern" components/
```

### 2. Search Session History

```bash
# Search agent session todos
grep -r "similar_feature|pattern" ~/.claude/todos/ 2>/dev/null

# Find recent implementation patterns
ls -lt ~/.claude/todos/ | head -20
```

### 3. Consult Documentation

- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Workflow and git process
- `docs/database/DATA_DICTIONARY.md` - Database schema (SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH)
- `docs/database/RLS_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` - Row Level Security (MANDATORY for DB ops)
- `docs/security/SECURITY_FIRST_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Security patterns

### 4. Architectural Validation

- Propose pattern to System Architect
- Get approval before implementation
- Document decision in session notes

## Agent Workflow

### Standard Agent Loop (Per Simon Willison)

1. **Clear Goal** - BSA defines with acceptance criteria
2. **Pattern Discovery** - Search codebase and sessions
3. **Iterative Problem Solving**:
   - Implement approach
   - Run validation command
   - If fails → analyze error, adjust, repeat
   - If blocked → escalate to TDM with context
4. **Evidence Attachment** - Session ID + validation results in Linear

### No Over-Engineering

- ❌ No file locks
- ❌ No circuit breakers
- ❌ No arbitrary retry limits
- ✅ Let agents iterate until success or blocked
- ✅ Agent decides when to escalate

## Session Archaeology

### Monitor Concurrent Sessions

```bash
# See active sessions
ls -lt ~/.claude/todos/*.json | head -10

# Check for concurrent work on same files
grep -l "file_path" ~/.claude/todos/*.json
```

### Cross-Agent Coordination

```bash
# Find related work by another agent
grep -r "linear_ticket_number" ~/.claude/todos/

# Discover implementation patterns
grep -r "withUserContext|withAdminContext" ~/.claude/todos/
```

## 🎯 Agent Invocation Examples

### Simple Invocation (Direct Mention)

Use `@agent-name` for simple, single-step tasks:

```bash
# Planning
@bsa Create a spec for user profile API endpoint
@system-architect Review the RLS policy for user_profiles table

# Implementation
@be-developer Implement the GET /api/user/profile endpoint
@fe-developer Create a UserProfile component with form validation
@data-engineer Add email_verified column to users table

# Quality & Documentation
@qas Write integration tests for user profile feature
@security-engineer Audit RLS policies for user_profiles table
@tech-writer Document the user profile API in README

# Coordination
@tdm Coordinate implementation of {TICKET_PREFIX}-123 user profile feature
@rte Create PR for {TICKET_PREFIX}-123 and run CI validation
```

### Task Tool Invocation (Complex Tasks)

Use `Task()` for complex, multi-step tasks with detailed instructions:

```typescript
// BSA: Create comprehensive spec
Task({
  subagent_type: "bsa",
  description: "Create spec for {TICKET_PREFIX}-123",
  prompt: `Create comprehensive spec for {TICKET_PREFIX}-123 user profile feature.

Requirements:
- User can view and edit their profile
- Profile includes: name, email, bio, avatar
- Email verification required
- Admin can view all profiles

Please:
1. Search for existing user/profile patterns in docs/patterns/
2. Create user story with acceptance criteria
3. Define testing strategy (unit, integration, E2E)
4. Add #EXPORT_CRITICAL tags for security requirements
5. Reference relevant patterns from pattern library`,
});

// Backend Developer: Implement with pattern discovery
Task({
  subagent_type: "be-developer",
  description: "Implement {TICKET_PREFIX}-123 API",
  prompt: `Read spec at specs/{TICKET_PREFIX}-123-user-profile-spec.md

Implement the user profile API endpoints:
1. GET /api/user/profile - Get current user's profile
2. PUT /api/user/profile - Update current user's profile
3. GET /api/admin/users/:id/profile - Admin view any profile

Requirements:
- Use withUserContext for user endpoints
- Use withAdminContext for admin endpoints
- Follow RLS patterns from docs/patterns/database/
- Validate input with Zod schemas
- Write unit tests for each endpoint

Pattern discovery is MANDATORY before implementation.`,
});

// QAS: Execute comprehensive testing
Task({
  subagent_type: "qas",
  description: "Test {TICKET_PREFIX}-123 feature",
  prompt: `Read spec at specs/{TICKET_PREFIX}-123-user-profile-spec.md

Execute the testing strategy defined by BSA:

1. Unit Tests:
   - Test Zod validation schemas
   - Test RLS context helpers
   - Test error handling

2. Integration Tests:
   - Test GET /api/user/profile with user context
   - Test PUT /api/user/profile with valid/invalid data
   - Test admin endpoints with admin context
   - Test RLS isolation (user A cannot see user B's data)

3. E2E Tests:
   - User can view their profile
   - User can edit their profile
   - Admin can view any profile
   - Unauthorized access is blocked

Validate all acceptance criteria from the spec.`,
});

// TDM: Reactive blocker resolution (NOT orchestration)
Task({
  subagent_type: "tdm",
  description: "Resolve blocker for {TICKET_PREFIX}-123",
  prompt: `A blocker has been reported for {TICKET_PREFIX}-123.

TDM Responsibilities (per v1.3 SOP):
1. Monitor progress - read session archaeology, Linear, PR comments
2. Identify blocker details - search for "FAILED|error|blocked"
3. Escalate to appropriate specialist to resolve
4. Track evidence - attach session IDs, test results to Linear
5. Update Linear ticket with resolution

NOTE: TDM is REACTIVE, not an orchestrator.
ARCHitect-in-CLI is the primary orchestrator.`,
});
```

### When to Use Which Invocation Method

| Scenario                  | Method         | Example                                             |
| ------------------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Simple question**       | Direct mention | `@bsa What patterns exist for user authentication?` |
| **Single-step task**      | Direct mention | `@be-developer Add logging to the login endpoint`   |
| **Multi-step task**       | Task tool      | BSA creating spec with pattern discovery            |
| **Complex coordination**  | Task tool      | Multiple agents working on related features         |
| **Detailed requirements** | Task tool      | QAS executing comprehensive test strategy           |
| **Blocker resolution**    | Task tool      | TDM investigating and escalating blockers           |

### Pro Tips

1. **Always reference specs**: `Read spec at specs/{TICKET_PREFIX}-XXX-spec.md`
2. **Mandate pattern discovery**: `Pattern discovery is MANDATORY before implementation`
3. **Check #EXPORT_CRITICAL tags**: `Review #EXPORT_CRITICAL tags in spec first`
4. **Validate with commands**: Use success validation commands from agent prompts
5. **Update Linear**: TDM can update Linear with `mcp__linear-mcp__create_comment`
6. **TDM is reactive**: Don't use TDM for orchestration—use ARCHitect-in-CLI

---

**Quick Start**: Read CONTRIBUTING.md, search codebase, propose to System Architect, validate with test command, attach evidence to Linear.
