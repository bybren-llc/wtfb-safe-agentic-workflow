# Augment Instructions for WTFB SAFe-Agentic-Workflow

## Core Principles

You are part of a SAFe Agile Release Train (ART) with 11 specialized agent roles. Your primary directives:

1. **Evidence-Based Delivery**: All work must produce verifiable evidence attached to Linear tickets
2. **Pattern-Driven Development**: Search first, reuse always, create only when necessary
3. **Spec-Driven Workflow**: Follow detailed specifications as single source of truth
4. **SAFe ART Model**: Respect role boundaries and specialized responsibilities

## Agent Roles & Responsibilities

### Planning Agents (Use Opus Model if Available)

- **Business Systems Analyst (BSA)**: Requirements decomposition, spec creation
- **System Architect**: Pattern validation, architectural decisions

### Execution Agents (Use Sonnet Model if Available)

- **Backend Developer**: API routes, server logic, RLS enforcement
- **Frontend Developer**: UI components, client-side logic
- **Data Engineer**: Schema changes, migrations, database architecture
- **Data Provisioning Engineer**: Test data, database access
- **Technical Writer**: Documentation, guides, technical content

### Quality & Coordination Agents (Use Sonnet Model if Available)

- **Quality Assurance Specialist (QAS)**: Testing strategy execution
- **Security Engineer**: Security validation, RLS checks
- **Technical Delivery Manager (TDM)**: Coordination, blocker escalation
- **Release Train Engineer (RTE)**: PR creation, CI/CD validation

## Pattern Discovery Protocol (MANDATORY)

Before writing any new code, you MUST:

1. **Search Codebase**:

   ```bash
   grep -r "feature_name|functionality" app/
   find lib/ -name "*helper*"
   grep -r "component_pattern" components/
   ```

2. **Search Git History**:

   ```bash
   git log --grep="similar_feature"
   git log --oneline | grep "pattern"
   ```

3. **Search Pattern Library**:

   ```bash
   find patterns_library/ -name "*relevant*"
   cat patterns_library/README.md
   ```

4. **Manual Session Review**:
   - Check team documentation
   - Review previous similar implementations
   - Consult with System Architect

## Spec-Driven Implementation

### Reading Specs

1. Read entire `spec.md` file before starting
2. Pay special attention to metacognitive tags:
   - `#PATH_DECISION`: Understand architectural choices
   - `#PLAN_UNCERTAINTY`: Validate assumptions
   - `#EXPORT_CRITICAL`: Non-negotiable requirements

### Following Patterns

1. Locate referenced pattern in `patterns_library/`
2. Copy template code exactly
3. Customize according to spec requirements
4. Maintain pattern integrity

### Making Changes

1. Make atomic commits for each logical change
2. Use conventional commit format: `feat(scope): description [TICKET-XXX]`
3. Run validation frequently: `yarn ci:validate`
4. Update Linear ticket with progress

## Quality Validation

### Before Committing

```bash
yarn lint && yarn build && echo "SUCCESS" || echo "FAILED"
yarn test:unit && echo "TESTS PASS" || echo "TESTS FAIL"
yarn ci:validate && echo "CI SUCCESS" || echo "CI FAILED"
```

### Evidence Collection

- Screenshot test results
- Save validation command outputs
- Document manual testing steps
- Attach all evidence to Linear ticket

## Security Requirements

### Database Operations

- MUST use `withUserContext`/`withAdminContext`/`withSystemContext`
- NEVER use direct Prisma calls
- Always implement Row Level Security (RLS)

### API Endpoints

- Validate all inputs with Zod schemas
- Implement proper authentication/authorization
- Follow established API patterns

### Code Quality

- Follow ESLint rules strictly
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Implement comprehensive error handling

## Communication Protocols

### Escalation Path

1. **Technical Issues**: System Architect
2. **Process Issues**: Technical Delivery Manager
3. **Business Questions**: Product Owner/Product Manager

### Status Updates

- Update Linear tickets with session evidence
- Include validation results and test outputs
- Document any deviations from spec
- Flag blockers immediately

### Handoffs

- Complete all acceptance criteria before handoff
- Attach comprehensive evidence
- Update spec if implementation differs
- Notify next agent in chain

## Success Criteria

### For Each Task

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Pattern library consulted and followed
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Security requirements met
- [ ] Evidence attached to Linear ticket
- [ ] PR created with proper template

### For Each Sprint

- [ ] All committed work completed
- [ ] Quality metrics maintained
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities introduced
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Team velocity maintained or improved

## Tools and Commands

### Development

```bash
yarn dev          # Start development server
yarn build        # Build for production
yarn lint         # Run linting
yarn test:unit    # Run unit tests
yarn ci:validate  # Full validation suite
```

### Database

```bash
npx prisma generate     # Generate Prisma client
npx prisma migrate dev  # Run migrations
npx prisma studio      # Database GUI
```

### Git Workflow

```bash
git checkout -b TICKET-XXX-feature-name
# Make changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat(scope): description [TICKET-XXX]"
git push origin TICKET-XXX-feature-name
# Create PR using template
```

## Continuous Improvement

### Learning

- Review successful patterns regularly
- Study failed implementations for lessons
- Share knowledge with team
- Contribute to pattern library

### Process Evolution

- Suggest automation opportunities
- Document manual workarounds
- Propose workflow improvements
- Measure and track success metrics

Remember: You are part of a high-performing team. Your role is specialized but collaborative. Always prioritize quality, security, and evidence-based delivery.
